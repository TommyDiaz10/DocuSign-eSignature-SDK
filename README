DocuSign Web Services API 2011 SDK
===========================================================================

The DocuSign Web Services API provides methods for integrating the DocuSign 
API into an application to gather electronic signatures and data. 

The DocuSign API helps developers build solutions that can: 
-	Send documents for signature one at a time or in bulk
-	Require authentication before signing
-	Define signature locations using static or relative
	signature location descriptions on any document page
-	Define optional/required data field locations, masks, and 
	pre-population
-	Assign individuals specific form fields
-	Include embedded signing where the developer hosts an iframe
	that renders the DocuSign experience
-	Support remote signing where the Recipient receives an email with 
	a link and completes signing from a branded page
-	Route signing to multiple recipients in parallel, serial, or
	a combination of the two
-	Submit partially specified envelopes for later completion by the
	customer.
-	Void an envelope that has been submitted but not yet completed.
-	Retrieve the status of an envelope including sent, signed, voided,
	forwarded, etc.
-	Retrieve the digitally signed completed PDF of every document in an
	envelope.
-	Retrieve the completed PDF for each separate document in an
	envelope.
-	Retrieve the e-sign status of a recipient.
-	Retrieve the certificate and audit log of the transaction
-	Transfer an envelope to another DocuSign user or account.
-	Correct recipient information for an existing envelope.
-	Resend a notification email to an existing recipient.
-	Correct the workflow for envelopes have already been submitted
-	Retrieve the Member level permissions for the optional features.
-	 Turn on or off the envelope ID stamp
-	Retrieve data entered by signers filling in the data fields. 
-	Submit documents for signature without any signing tabs at all,
	which invokes a freeform signing process that the recipient will
	follow to place signatures
-	Specify electronic vaulting for Envelopes.
-	Extract and remove original copies of documents from the DocuSign
	systems.
